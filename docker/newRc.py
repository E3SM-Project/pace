#Purpose: Create a new pacerc file. This either generates one, or grabs a "file" from the arguments.
#This is designed to be used in docker where you can't send files through standard input, but it can also be used standalone.

Create a new rc file for PACE (as of this writing). It can be used standalone, or as part of dockerExec.sh (original intent)
Variables can be simply typed straight from arguments, or have associated variable names with them (e.g var=value), but only one method can be used per command call.

The result is printed to stdout, so to save this config, the user would do the following in bash: """+sys.argv[0]+""" [args] >> /path/to/rcFile

List of variables:

Shortcut | variable name
"""+rcValStr
