<h2>Advanced search</h2>
<p>In addition to normal searches, you can also perform advanced searches that assist in narrowing down results. To start, type in a category (name, machine, etc). Next, type <code><b>:</b></code> followed by the keyword you wish to search for. </p>
<code>user:sarat machine:titan</code>
<h3>List of available categories</h3>
<ul class="catList">
    
</ul>

<h2>Other Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In a typical search, the search engine looks for values similar to the keywords entered. Prepending <code><b>$</b></code> to a keyword indicates you're looking for an <i>exact match</i>, and only shows results with that exact value. This tends to be more effective on advanced searches.</li>
    <li>More than one search can be performed at a time in the search box. <i>Use the vertial line/pipe</i> (<code><b>|</b></code>) after each search to chain results together. The search engine will make sure everything is unique.<br><br>
    In this example, one search is looking for users with the name "sarat", and a completely separate search is looking only for names matching "worley". Both results are displayed on the homepage table after the searches are complete.<br>
    <code>user:sarat | user:worley</code>
    </li>
</ul>
