<h2>About</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://e3sm.org"><i>Energy Exascale Earth System Model</i> <b>(E3SM)</b></a> is a high-resolution coupled Earth system model that is designed to address energy-related science challenges
while effficiently utilizing Department of Energy (DOE) supercomputers.
<br> <b>PACE</b> enables climate scientists to view executive summary of E3SM experiments' performance and interactively deep-dive as desired.
</p>
<h2> Architecture </h2>
<p>
    <img src="/static/img/workflow.png"/><br>
    Domain or computer scientists export experiment data from a computational platform (e.g., Summit)  to PACE using an upload tool. PACE processes and ingests that information into the backend database. Finally, an user can interactively explore the performance data through the web portal. 
</p>
<h3> Visualization Pipeline </h3>
<p>
    <img src="/static/img/domConnection.svg"/><br>
    Upon selection of a specific experiment, PACE reads the detailed timing profile to generate the process tree in a format suitable for visualization via the web portal.
