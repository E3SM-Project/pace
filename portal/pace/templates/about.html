<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Understanding computational performance of a complex coupled model like the <a href="https://e3sm.org"><i>Energy Exascale Earth System Model</i> <b> (E3SM)</b></a> poses a singular challenge to domain and computational scientists. Toward that goal, we developed PACE (Performance Analytics for Computational Experiments), a web-enabled framework to summarize performance data collected from E3SM experiments to derive insights and present them through a web portal. 
<br>

<p>
The primary goal of PACE is to serve as a central hub of performance data to provide an executive summary of E3SM experiment performance. 
<br>
Additionally, PACE is designed to enable the following capabilities:

<ul>
<li>    Interactive analyses and deep-dives into experiments and application sub-regions, as desired,
<li>    Tracking performance benchmarks and simulation campaigns of interest,
<li>    Facilitating performance research on load balancing and process layouts,
<li>    Identification of bottlenecks to inform targeted optimization efforts.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Presently, it contains data for <b>{{nexps}}</b> experiments.
</p>
<h2> Architecture </h2>

<a href="/static/img/pace_arch.png"><img class="center" src="/static/img/pace_arch.png"/></a><br></p>
<p>
    Performance data from simulations executed on supported supercomputers is automatically uploaded to PACE. 
<br>
    PACE processes and ingests that information into the backend database. 
<br>
    Finally, an user can interactively explore the performance data through the web portal.
