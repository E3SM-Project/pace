Performance Analytics for Computational Experiments (PACE)
================================================================================

Understanding computational performance of a complex coupled model like the 
Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) poses a singular challenge to domain 
and computational scientists. Toward that goal, we developed 
PACE (Performance Analytics for Computational Experiments) , 
a web-enabled framework to summarize performance data collected from E3SM 
experiments to derive insights and present them through a web portal.

The primary goal of PACE is to serve as a central hub of performance data 
to provide an executive summary of E3SM experiments' performance.
